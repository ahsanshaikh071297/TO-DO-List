# Overview
This project is a To-Do Task Manager web application that utilizes IndexedDB as the database for storing tasks locally in the user's browser. It also integrates Microsoft Authentication to provide user login and logout functionality. The user interface (UI) follows the Glassmorphism design trend, providing a modern and visually appealing experience.

# Features
CRUD Operations: Users can perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks.
IndexedDB Database: Tasks are stored locally in the user's browser using IndexedDB, providing offline access and persistence.
Microsoft Authentication: Users can securely log in and log out using their Microsoft account credentials.
Glassmorphism UI: The UI design follows the Glassmorphism trend, featuring translucent elements and frosted glass effects for a modern look and feel.

# Technologies Used
Angular: Frontend development framework used to build the web application.
IndexedDB: Web browser database for storing tasks locally.
Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL): Library used to integrate Microsoft Authentication into the application.
HTML, CSS, TypeScript: Languages used for building the frontend components and logic.
Glassmorphism: UI design trend implemented using CSS for the translucent and frosted glass effects.

# Configuration:
